You are building a single-page landing site for a premium sneaker brand called Hashcode.
The brand is minimal, black-only, anti-hype, anti-logo, inspired by terminal / encryption aesthetics.
The page should feel like a secure system booting, not a marketing website.

Audience: design-aware Gen Z / early adopters.
Goal: collect name + email for a waitlist.
No images. No gradients. No colors other than black and white.
